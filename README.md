# ScreenObject

This package offers a starting point on which to implement the [page object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) pattern for UI testing iOS applications.
In the context of mobile apps, there are screen, not pages, so we refer to the pattern as _screen object_.

⚠️ This pacakge is still in early development and it's subject to change.

There is no documentation yet.
Refer to the UI tests in the TestAppUITests target to see this package in action.
